# Predicting Emergency Department (ED) Wait Times with AutoML
ðŸ“Œ Project Overview

This project addresses the challenge of long and unpredictable wait times in hospital emergency departments (ED).
We used a simulated dataset (5,000 records) of ED visits and applied AutoML (MLJAR) alongside baseline ML models (Linear Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost).
